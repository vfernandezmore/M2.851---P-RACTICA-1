Bustling cafes. Posh boutiques. The Opal is at the heart of River North. This five-story brick building is covered in large windows, mirroring the beautiful skyscrapers around it. Inside, chic decor, in-suite laundry, and a fully equipped kitchen complete your apartment. Step outside, and you’ll be amidst endless dining and entertainment. The cavatelli from Quartino Ristorante is our favorite guilty pleasure. Or, if you’d prefer a home-cooked meal, there’s a Whole Foods Market right down the street. Take your time wandering around the Museum of Contemporary Art or the City Gallery inside a historic water tower. Experience Chicago with a comfortable stay at The Opal.",,Sonder The Opal,,
